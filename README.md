Instructions (Tutorial Is Coming Very Soon!)

To get started, it would be a good idea to head over to the store and pick up a common booster pack, this will grant you 5 decent starting items, then return to the main menu and go to start game, the game with take you through some screens of fake "server contecting messages, and finding oppenent" for a little extra Style, and then you will be pit against one of three bots, Sarah, Joe, and Hikaru. For Sarah I'd recomend using a rock attack, for Joe paper, and hikaru scissors. once you've gotten your first win, you'll notice that you've recieved a free item you can accept or deny this offer but Items are very good to have, along with items you also gain $10 in-game currency and 1 level.

MORE ITEMS BOTS AND CONENT COMING SOON
